# Overview 
This project is a YouTube Clone Application where I have invested significant effort to recreate the core functionalities and design of the official YouTube app. My goal was to make it as close as possible to the original, both in terms of user interface and features.

# Features 
- **Dynamic UI** - A responsive and user-friendly design for seamless navigation.
- **Routing** - Smooth navigation between pages, like the home screen, video playback, and search results.
- **Video Playback** - Users can watch videos directly within the app.
- **API Integration** - Utilized the YouTube API for fetching real-time video data and the Google Search Suggestion API for search functionality.

# Tech Stack
- React.js
- Redux.js
- Tailwind CSS
